# cat-vs-noncat-image-classification
This was an assignment project from my freshman year and my first data science project. It's an image classification project that classifies images as cat or non-cat.

My task was to complete all functions with given templates to create a 2-layer neural network model.
Trained model has accuracy of %82.

The project uses python and python data science libraries Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.



IMPORTANT!

To run the project:
Go to DATASET section and give the path of dataset folder to load_data function
